  * backdoor - A back door is a means of access to a computer program that bypasses security mechanisms.
  * botnet - A botnet is a collection of compromised computers often referred to as "zombies" infected with malware that allows an attacker to control them.
  * brute force - Brute force (also known as brute force cracking) is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys, through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than employing intellectual strategies.
  * exploit - An exploit is the use of software, data, or commands to “exploit” a weakness in a computer system or program to carry out some form of malicious intent, such as a denial-of-service attack, Trojan horses, worms or viruses.
  * key logger - A keylogger is a technology that tracks and records consecutive key strokes on a keyboard. Because sensitive information such as usernames and passwords are often entered on a keyboard, a keylogger can be a very dangerous technology.
